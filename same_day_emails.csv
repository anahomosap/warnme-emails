On 06-08-2021 13:15:00, a hate crime - intimidation was reported to have occurred on the 3100 Block of Dwight Way (next to Clark Kerr Campus). 

The suspect threatened the victim, claiming he had a knife, but no weapon was seen. The phrases and words used by the suspect and directed at the victim led UCPD officers to believe this incident was racially motivated. The incident was later reported to UCPD officers and the investigation is ongoing.

Intimidation is to unlawfully place another person in reasonable fear of bodily harm through the use of threatening words and/or other conduct, but without displaying a weapon or subjecting the victim to actual physical attack.


A hate crime is a criminal offense that manifests evidence that the victim was intentionally selected because of the perpetrator's bias against the victim.

UCPD (510) 642-6760
