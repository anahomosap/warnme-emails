# WarnMe Notification System Analysis

This project uses collected emails from the UC Berkeley WarnMe Notification system (all from my inbox) over the course of three years (emails range from May 18, 2021  to December 28, 2023). The WarnMe notification system is used as a result of the Clery Act that enforces all public universities to provide university students, faculty, and staff with information about crimes and potential hazards that occur on campus or near campus-affiliated buildings. Since entering the school, I was curious about the effectiveness of the system since the emails seem to send out notifications far too late. 

The current focus of this project is to clean and re arrange the data of emails into a workable dataset as well as prepare some analysis based on the collected data (this portion is still being worked on). 

The project currently has five python notebook files that are split based on the tasks they complete:


1) **1.UnravelingText.ipynb**
2) **2.Importing Emails and Cleaning up Data.ipynb**
3) **3.Cleaning_WarnMeEmails.ipynb**
4) **4.Absolute_Crimes.ipynb**
5) **5.Analysis.ipynb**
