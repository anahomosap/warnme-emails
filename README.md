# WarnMe Notification System Analysis

The following project uses collected emails from the UC Berkeley WarnMe Notification system (all from my inbox) over the course of three years (emails range from May 18, 2021  to December 28, 2023).

The primary focus of this project was to clean and re arrange the data of emails into a workable dataset as well as prepare some analysis based on the collected data (this portion is still being worked on).
