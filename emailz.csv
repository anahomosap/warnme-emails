Please note this message may contain information that some may find upsetting.

On 06-08-2021 13:15:00, a hate crime - intimidation was reported to have occurred on the 3100 Block of Dwight Way (next to Clark Kerr Campus). 

The suspect threatened the victim, claiming he had a knife, but no weapon was seen. The phrases and words used by the suspect and directed at the victim led UCPD officers to believe this incident was racially motivated. The incident was later reported to UCPD officers and the investigation is ongoing.

Intimidation is to unlawfully place another person in reasonable fear of bodily harm through the use of threatening words and/or other conduct, but without displaying a weapon or subjecting the victim to actual physical attack.


A hate crime is a criminal offense that manifests evidence that the victim was intentionally selected because of the perpetrator's bias against the victim.

If you have any information about this crime, please contact: 
UCPD (510) 642-6760

UCPD recognizes and places a high priority on the rights of all individuals guaranteed under state and federal law.  The commission of a hate crime is a serious offense, which will not be tolerated.

During the month of June, as a tribute of our support and service to the LGBTQ+ community, all employees, sworn and professional staff, are encouraged to show their support by wearing a Pride lapel pin on either their uniform or in plainclothes. The pins are provided at no cost to all employees.


UCPD values our diverse community and is dedicated to treating all people with dignity and respect. Through our partnerships and continuing education, we strive to create an inclusive culture and welcoming environment for those who choose to visit, work, study, and be of service in our community.

Community Advisory: Work-Study Internet Scam



Please be aware of a common internet scam that is targeting members of the campus community.


In this type of scam, the suspects typically make contact by telephone or e-mail and pretend to offer a work-study position as a personal assistant. The suspects send a check to the student and instruct them to deposit the check into their personal bank account. The suspects then direct the student to go to a store to purchase gift cards for the value of the check. The suspects direct the student to provide photographs of the gift card numbers. If successful, the suspects may request additional gift cards until the student stops cooperating. By the time the student checks their bank account and discovers the suspects' check has not cleared, the suspects have already received the gift cards.


Legitimate employers do not provide checks in exchange for gift cards. If you are targeted by this type of scam, do not make any payments or provide any personal information to the suspect. End the communication. Preserve any information about the suspect that you might have (e.g. messages or identifying information) in case you decide to file a police report. To make a police report, contact your local law enforcement agency, or UCPD if the scam occurred on campus: (510) 642-6760.


Reporting these types of scams to authorities may help direct resources to combating the problem, but you should also know it can be difficult to identify and hold accountable the suspects in these types of incidents.

Thank you for doing your part to conserve energy on campus this last weekend. The Berkeley campus was able to return unused power to the grid and the State was able to avoid any major power outages during the heatwave.

You may now resume normal activity on campus.

Thank you.

Due to extreme temperatures expected this weekend throughout California, Governor Newsom has asked all university campuses to reduce power usage for the next 48 to 72 hours. The Berkeley campus is supplied by our cogeneration plant which provides electricity to the campus.  It is important that we stay within the plant’s capacity over the next few days so we do not increase demand on the grid.




Please help conserve energy this weekend so that we can do our part to support the state. 





Thank you.

Advisory: Fourth of July Holiday Road Closure on UC Berkeley Campus and bordering Grizzly Peak Blvd


Centennial Drive between Stadium Rim Way and Grizzly Peak Boulevard will be closed to traffic beginning on Sunday, July 4th, 2021, at 6:00am through Monday, July 5th, 2021, at 5:00am. The road closure is part of a collaborative, multi-jurisdictional effort to deter fire incidents during this extreme fire season. Additionally, all of the parking areas and turnout areas connected to these roadways will be closed. 


Historically, the UC Berkeley parking lots and the emergency turnouts along Grizzly Peak Boulevard have been popular spots to view the San Francisco Bay Area skyline on Independence Day. This has caused overcrowding, illegal parking in the roadway and delayed emergency services’ response to calls for service. In response to the high fire danger expected, the following road closures will be in effect on and near the UC Berkeley Campus. 


The following parking lots will be closed beginning on Sunday, July 4th, 2021, at 6:00am, and re-opening on Monday, July 5th, 2021, at 5:00am:

*	Lawrence Hall of Science (LHS) Lots

*	LHS Vista Lot

*	Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) Terrace Lots

*	LHS East Lot

*	Space Sciences Lot

09:24:37 01-18-2022 There has been a surge in positive COVID-19 cases on campus over the last two weeks, as expected. With the high transmissibility of the omicron variant and the return of more students and staff to campus, we anticipate that the number will continue to increase through January.

You’re reminded to continue to follow requirements for being on campus <https://coronavirus.berkeley.edu/campus-access/> , including wearing face coverings while indoors <https://coronavirus.berkeley.edu/face-coverings/>  and staying home when sick. Please also review the information on what to do if you test positive <https://uhs.berkeley.edu/coronavirus/testing-covid-19/what-do-if-test-positive> .

Given the surge in cases, and the related overwhelming increase in contact tracing and case investigations, University Health Services data-gathering efforts will be stretched. We do not anticipate sending additional WarnMe notifications until the current spike in omicron variant cases has decelerated. Meanwhile, the campus dashboard <https://coronavirus.berkeley.edu/dashboard/>  will continue to provide information about testing conducted by UHS. (It does not include at-home self-testing and off-campus testing, even if reported to UHS, for example).

To the UC Berkeley community:

UC Berkeley is asking students, faculty, and staff to conserve energy today, September 6, in particular from 4:00 p.m. - 9:00 p.m. 

The California Independent System Operator has issued a statewide call for voluntary electricity conservation today in order to stabilize the state's power grid and prevent outages. 

Consumers are urged to conserve electricity, especially during the late afternoon and early evening, when the grid is most stressed due to higher demand and less solar energy.

Please conserve energy as much as possible today to help reduce stress on the power grid and avoid potentially devastating outages statewide. 

Here are some examples of steps you can take to conserve energy on campus:

* Run high-energy experiments during off-peak hours
* Turn off unnecessary lights
* Close window blinds
* Turn off unused electrical devices (eg: AV equipment)

On 11-30-2022 20:45:00, a sexual battery occurred at a UC Berkeley Residence Hall.

A female student reported seeing the suspect in the lobby of her building around 8:45 pm on 11/30/22. The suspect was short and small in stature, possibly a juvenile. He was wearing a black hoody and a yellow ski mask. The reporting party took the elevator upstairs alone. A short time later, she felt the suspect grab her buttocks with both hands. She turned and saw him run down the stairs. About five minutes later, the reporting party returned to the lobby with a friend and saw the suspect again. He ran from the building when he saw the reporting party.
